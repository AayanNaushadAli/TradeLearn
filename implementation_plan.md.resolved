# Implement React/Tailwind UI in Android Jetpack Compose

## Goal Description
The objective is to overhaul the Android app (`com.example.tradelearn`) UI to mathematically and visually match the provided Tailwind CSS-based web designs inside the `img-layout` and `trading-academy` React project. 

The Android app will use **Jetpack Compose** to build these visually rich interfaces, incorporating smooth gradients, dynamic shapes for nodes (like the learning path map), progress bars, custom icons, and interactive states. 

No DB scheme or backend logic changes are required unless necessitated by the new UI components. (The SQL fix [04_fix_user_trigger.sql](file:///c:/Users/aayan/OneDrive/Desktop/TradeLearn/sql/04_fix_user_trigger.sql) has already been created to address user sign-up DB errors).

## Proposed Changes

We will refactor or create the following UI components in `app/src/main/java/com/example/tradelearn/ui/`:

### 1. Theming & Colors
*   **[MODIFY]** `theme/Color.kt` and `theme/Theme.kt`
    *   Add the tailwind color palette (Slate 900/500/100, Blue 500, Yellow 400 for stars, Red 500 for hearts, Green 500 for lessons, etc.).

### 2. Main Navigation & Bottom Bar
*   **[MODIFY]** `navigation/MainNavigation.kt`
    *   Add the new screens (`LeaderboardScreen`, `QuestsScreen`) to the navigation graph.
    *   Update the `BottomNavigationBar` to have 5 tabs matching the UI (Home, Leaderboard, Quests, Profile - maybe removing one depending on the actual design). The typical Duolingo-style bottom bar has these main tabs.

### 3. Home / Learning Path Dashboard
*   **[MODIFY]** `HomeMapScreen.kt`
    *   Build a vertical scrollable column representing the learning path map.
    *   Implement custom Box/Canvas nodes connected by dashed curved lines (or simple vertical connectors).
    *   States for nodes: Completed (Star), Current (Bouncing Tooltip & Blue Pulsing Ring), Locked (Greyed out).
    *   Add the floating "Guidebook" button.

### 4. Interactive Lesson Screen
*   **[MODIFY]** `LessonScreen.kt`
    *   **Header**: Progress bar, X button to close, Heart count.
    *   **Main**: Top prompt text, Interactive Chart Graphic (Candlesticks built with simple Box shapes or Canvas).
    *   **Options Array**: Selectable rounded rectangles with letter prefix (A, B, C, D) and border highlighting.
    *   **Footer**: Sliding bottom-bar that changes color (Green/Red) upon answering, complete with "Check/Continue" button.

### 5. Profile Screen
*   **[MODIFY]** `ProfileScreen.kt`
    *   **Header**: User Avatar, Name, Join Date.
    *   **Stats Grid**: 2x2 grid showing Day Streak, Total XP, Current League, and Top 3 Finishes.
    *   **Tabs**: TabRow for Badges / Stats.
    *   **Content**: Vertical list of unlocked/locked achievements.

### 6. Quests Screen
*   **[NEW]** `QuestsScreen.kt`
    *   Daily & Monthly quest categories.
    *   LinearProgressIndicator for each quest track.
    *   Reward chest icons.

### 7. Leaderboard Screen
*   **[NEW]** `LeaderboardScreen.kt`
    *   Top 3 podium display for 1st, 2nd, 3rd place with customized heights and medals.
    *   LazyColumn for the remaining users in the league.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
*   Build the Android project (`./gradlew assembleDebug` or similar).
*   Run the app in the emulator or via Compose Preview.
*   Visually inspect the exact pixel padding, color matches, typography scale, and shape corner radii against the reference HTML/PNG files natively inside Android Studio or an Emulator.
